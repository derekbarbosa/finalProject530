<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project

The goal of this project is to implement an all inclusive, self-service mobile application for travel planning. Many applications and websites such as kayak, expeida, and Google do bookings for accomodations, rentals, and flights, but do not have an easy to use platform for budgeting alongside planning. This application solves that problem. Travel There Yourself (TTY) gives users an easy to use platform for planning their vacations, road trips, and weekend getaways, keeping costs transparent so users can spend as little or as much as possible. 

<!-- APIs Documentation -->
### ðŸ“±: API Documentation

All APIs developed for this application are deployed via Flask REST Framework for Python on AWS EC2. We use the Google Maps API to give directions and hotel information to users. Apis are listed below:

    - Arguments: Username, Password, Email, 
    - Return values: "User successfully added" or "User already exists"
  - Get: check if a user already exists in the database
    - Arguments: Username, Password, Email
    - Return values: 1 on success, 0 if User doesn't exists
   
- AuthenticateUser
  - Get: Authenticate a User on login to the application
    - Arguments: Username, Password
    - Return values: 1 on success, 0 on failure


- AddTrip
  - Post: add a trip to the application's MongoDB Trips collection
    - Arguments: username, destination, departure date, return date, airline (yet to implement flights funtionality), hotel
    - Return values: "Trip to {destination} added" or "Trip to {destination} already exists"
 
- GetTrip
  - Get: Retrieve a User's trip from the database
    - Arguments: username, destination, departure date
    - Return values: JSON containing matching trip data for arguments

    - Arguments: destination, num_hotels
    - Return values: JSON structure containing the specified number of closest hotels and their address, rating, and an image

- GetDirections
  - Get: Uses google maps API to get the driving directions from a specified origin to a destination
    - Arguments: origin, destination
    - Return values: trip distance, trip destination, html verbose directions

- GetGasCost
  - Get: Uses EIA API to estimate the total gas cost of a trip based on the day's median gas price
    - Arguments: origin, destination, gas tank size, miles per gallon (mpg)
    - Return value: dollar value of estimated cost (int)
